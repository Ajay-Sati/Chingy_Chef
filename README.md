# Cingy Chef — Step-by-Step Cooking Guide (No-Code, Gemini-powered)

Cingy Chef is a no-code cooking assistant built using Gemini's no-code application tools. The app lets users name any dish and then guides them through the entire cooking process in an intuitive step-by-step format. Each cooking step is presented as concise text and simultaneously narrated aloud, so users can follow along hands-free while they cook. Cingy Chef is ideal for beginners who need clear guidance and for busy cooks who prefer voice-led instructions in the kitchen.
When you provide the name of a dish, Cingy Chef generates a complete recipe workflow that includes ingredients, preparation steps, cooking techniques, estimated times, and plating suggestions. The instructions are written in simple, actionable language and broken down into sequential steps that are easy to follow. In addition to visual instructions, the app uses voice narration to dictate each step, allowing users to keep their hands free and their focus on the task at hand.
